# Accessibility Conformance Report

Based on VPAT® Version 2.5Rev (EU edition: WCAG and EN 301 549)

**Name of product and version:** ITSG-33 Compliance Navigator 1.2.0  
**Report date:** 2026-10-15 (manual evaluation); automated results recompiled with each commit  
**Product description:** A browser-based tool for reviewing a software product against Canada's ITSG-33 security controls: scoping interview, documentation review, a guided questionnaire with “Gemba walk” guidance for each control, and a generated compliance report. Runs entirely in the browser with no server-side processing or authentication.  
**Contact information:** https://github.com/numbap/Itsg33/issues/new?labels=accessibility&title=Accessibility%3A%20  
**Evaluator:** Claude (AI assistant, Anthropic). Self-assessment; no accessibility certification; not independent  
**Evaluation methods used:** WCAG 2.2 A/AA evaluation combining (1) axe-core automated rules on every page state in light and dark themes; (2) scripted Playwright checks for keyboard access, keyboard traps, focus visibility and contrast, focus obscuring, reflow at 320 CSS px, resize at 200%, text spacing, target size, non-text contrast, ARIA tabs, focus management and status messages; (3) code review of templates, styles and event handling; (4) visual inspection of light, dark and forced-colours rendering at several widths; and (5) review of the generated accessibility tree. Details are in the test methodology and test report.

## Build status

- Automated suite passed: 81 axe-core runs with no WCAG violations, and 435 scripted checks passed across 27 page states (axe-core 4.14.0, Chromium (Playwright 1.56.1)).
- Manual review pending. The user interface has changed since the last attested manual review (2026-10-15). Changed: index.html, css/styles.css, js/app.js. Automated results in this report are current; judgements based on code review or visual inspection must be re-confirmed (npm run a11y:attest).

## Notes

- Scope: the complete web interface (all views and states listed in the scope document) and the accessibility documentation pages. Generated export files (Markdown, CSV, JSON, printed PDF) are not evaluated as non-web documents.
- Evaluator: this report is a self-assessment carried out by an AI assistant (Claude, Anthropic) using automated tools, scripted browser checks, code review and visual inspection. No testing with screen readers or other assistive technology, and no testing by people with disabilities, has been performed yet. Only Chromium was tested. Independent verification is recommended; see the expertise and independence statement.
- Conformance levels for criteria with automated checks are recompiled on every commit. If an automated check fails, the affected criterion is downgraded automatically.

## WCAG 2.x Report

Summary: 45 Supports, 11 Not Applicable.

### Table 1: Success Criteria, Level A

| Criteria | Conformance level | Remarks and explanations |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1.1 Non-text Content | Supports | The logo graphic is hidden from assistive technology and accompanied by the product name in text. Progress rings and score bars use role=img with a text alternative giving the percentage. Decorative glyphs (disclosure triangle, check marks, theme icon) are hidden with aria-hidden or empty CSS alternative text. The theme button has an accessible name. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (role-img-alt); code review, accessibility tree inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) | Not Applicable | The product contains no audio or video. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) | Not Applicable | The product contains no audio or video. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) | Not Applicable | The product contains no video. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Supports | Structure is conveyed with native semantics: landmarks, headings in order, lists, data tables with captions and th scope, fieldset/legend for each question, labelled radio groups for scoping questions, and labels for every field. Evidence: 9 axe-core rules passed (aria-hidden-body, aria-required-children, aria-required-parent, definition-list, dlitem, list, listitem, td-headers-attr, th-has-data-cells); code review, accessibility tree inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence | Supports | DOM order matches visual reading order. The only CSS reordering places the main navigation below the product name on narrow screens, which does not change meaning. Evidence: code review, visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics | Supports | Instructions refer to sections by name, not by shape, size or position. One location-based instruction found during evaluation (“right-hand panel”) was reworded. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.1 Use of Color | Supports | Status, risk, applicability and severity are always shown as text. Selected answers show a check mark and bold text in addition to colour. Links within text are underlined. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (link-in-text-block); code review, visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.2 Audio Control | Not Applicable | The product plays no audio. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | Supports | All functions use native, keyboard-operable controls. Scripted checks Tab through every page state and confirm every focusable control is reached, that button-styled file pickers are keyboard operable, that the Gemba tabs work with arrow keys, and that questionnaire answers can be selected with the keyboard. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (scrollable-region-focusable); scripted checks keyboard-reach, lookalike-controls, tabs-pattern, status-messages (83 runs, all passed); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap | Supports | Scripted traversal confirms focus moves through and out of every page state. Evidence: scripted checks no-keyboard-trap (54 runs, all passed). |
| 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts | Not Applicable | No single-character shortcuts are defined. Arrow, Home and End keys act only while a tab has focus, and Escape dismisses the confirmation message. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable | Supports | The only time limit is the auto-lock for encrypted Protected storage (a security safeguard). Users can adjust it before encountering it, from 15 minutes to 8 hours (more than ten times the default), or turn it off on the Data and security page. Locking loses no work: the assessment is saved before locking and restored on unlock. Confirmation messages stay visible until dismissed. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide | Not Applicable | There is no moving, blinking, scrolling or auto-updating content. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold | Supports | No content flashes. Transitions are disabled when the user prefers reduced motion. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | Supports | A skip link is the first focusable element, and pages use banner, navigation, main and contentinfo landmarks. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (bypass); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.2 Page Titled | Supports | Each view sets a unique, descriptive document title on navigation (verified by the route-focus check). Documentation pages have unique titles. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (document-title); scripted checks route-focus (1 runs, all passed). |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Supports | Focus order follows the DOM. After in-app navigation focus moves to the new page heading (or to the requested control); after an action re-renders a view, focus returns to the control that triggered it. Evidence: scripted checks route-focus (1 runs, all passed); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) | Supports | Link text is descriptive or made clear by its card or list item (e.g. control links show the control ID and title). Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (link-name); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures | Not Applicable | No multipoint or path-based gestures are used. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation | Supports | All actions use native click activation, which fires on release and can be cancelled by moving the pointer away. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.5.3 Label in Name | Supports | Accessible names contain the visible label text. Buttons with extra context (“Apply: Where does it run?”, “Dismiss message”) start with the visible label. Evidence: code review, accessibility tree inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.5.4 Motion Actuation | Not Applicable | No functions are triggered by device motion. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.1.1 Language of Page | Supports | All pages declare lang="en". Evidence: 2 axe-core rules passed (html-has-lang, html-lang-valid). |
| 3.2.1 On Focus | Supports | Receiving focus never changes context. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.2.2 On Input | Supports | Changing a field updates related summaries, statuses and search results on the same page but never navigates, submits or moves focus. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.2.6 Consistent Help | Supports | Links to the accessibility statement and to the problem-reporting page appear in the same footer position on every application and documentation page. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.3.1 Error Identification | Supports | Form errors (passphrase rules, a wrong passphrase, a storage choice not allowed for the marking, import problems) appear in an error summary that receives focus and links to the field, with an inline message on the field, aria-invalid and aria-describedby. Other errors (analyzing empty text) are described in text and announced. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions | Supports | Every field has a visible label; scoping questions also explain why they are asked. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (form-field-multiple-labels); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.3.7 Redundant Entry | Supports | Information entered once (product name, organization, scope) is reused automatically in statements and reports; nothing has to be entered twice. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 4.1.1 Parsing (obsolete and removed in WCAG 2.2) | Supports | Removed in WCAG 2.2 and treated as always satisfied. For WCAG 2.0 and 2.1: markup is generated from templates with unique IDs, and the browser DOM is checked by axe-core for duplicate IDs referenced by ARIA. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | Supports | Native controls are used throughout. Custom patterns expose correct roles and states: tabs (tablist/tab/tabpanel, aria-selected, roving tabindex), the theme toggle (aria-pressed), the current page (aria-current) and disclosure (details/summary). Evidence: 17 axe-core rules passed (aria-allowed-attr, aria-conditional-attr, aria-deprecated-role, aria-hidden-body, aria-hidden-focus, aria-prohibited-attr, aria-required-attr, aria-roles, aria-valid-attr, aria-valid-attr-value, button-name, duplicate-id-aria, label, link-name, nested-interactive, select-name, summary-name); scripted checks lookalike-controls, route-focus, tabs-pattern (29 runs, all passed); accessibility tree inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |

### Table 2: Success Criteria, Level AA

| Criteria | Conformance level | Remarks and explanations |
|---|---|---|
| 1.2.4 Captions (Live) | Not Applicable | The product contains no live audio. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) | Not Applicable | The product contains no video. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.3.4 Orientation | Supports | No orientation lock; layouts were checked at portrait phone widths (320 px) and desktop widths. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose | Supports | Passphrase fields declare autocomplete="new-password" or "current-password". Other fields describe the product being assessed (name, responsible organization, scope), not the user, so no WCAG input purpose applies to them. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (autocomplete-valid); code review, accessibility tree inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | Supports | axe-core contrast checks pass in light and dark themes on every page state. Dark-theme accent colours were changed during evaluation to meet 4.5:1. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (color-contrast); visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.4 Resize Text | Supports | No loss of content or function at 200% zoom (640 CSS px viewport); text scales with browser zoom. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (meta-viewport); scripted checks reflow-640 (27 runs, all passed); visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.5 Images of Text | Supports | No images of text are used. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.10 Reflow | Supports | No two-dimensional scrolling at 320 CSS px on any page state. Data tables in the report scroll within their own container, which WCAG allows for content that needs two-dimensional layout. The header stops being sticky on narrow screens so it does not take space at high zoom. Evidence: scripted checks reflow-320 (27 runs, all passed); visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast | Supports | Field and choice boundaries have at least 3:1 contrast in both themes, and focus indicators have at least 3:1 against their background (both verified by scripted checks). Field borders were darkened during evaluation. Evidence: scripted checks focus-visible, non-text-contrast (108 runs, all passed); visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 1.4.12 Text Spacing | Supports | With the WCAG text-spacing overrides applied at 1280 px and 320 px, no content is clipped and no horizontal scrolling appears. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (avoid-inline-spacing); scripted checks text-spacing (54 runs, all passed). |
| 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus | Supports | No custom hover or focus pop-ups. Some badges have a native title tooltip, which is controlled by the browser. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.5 Multiple Ways | Supports | Main navigation, a family sidebar, previous/next links, and a searchable library of all controls. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.6 Headings and Labels | Supports | Headings and labels describe their topic or purpose; repeated “Questions” headings include the control ID for assistive technology. Evidence: code review, accessibility tree inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | Supports | Every focus stop on every page state shows an outline (scripted check), including visually hidden radio and file inputs, whose indicator appears on their visible label, and the date input's calendar button. Evidence: scripted checks focus-visible (54 runs, all passed); visual inspection (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) | Supports | Scroll padding keeps focused elements clear of the sticky header and of the confirmation message, which can also be dismissed with Escape. The scripted check confirms no focused element is hidden on any page state, including one with the message showing. Evidence: scripted checks focus-not-obscured (54 runs, all passed); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.5.7 Dragging Movements | Not Applicable | No dragging is required. (Text area resize handles are provided by the browser.) Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) | Supports | Every pointer target is at least 24 by 24 CSS px, except links inside sentences, which WCAG exempts (scripted check). The skip link and footer links were enlarged during evaluation. Evidence: 1 axe-core rule passed (target-size); scripted checks target-size (27 runs, all passed). |
| 3.1.2 Language of Parts | Supports | All product text is English. Text that users type (for example French notes) is shown as entered without a language tag, because the product cannot know its language. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation | Supports | The header navigation and footer are identical and in the same order on every view. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.2.4 Consistent Identification | Supports | Components with the same function use the same labels throughout (e.g. status and applicability badges, export buttons). Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.3.3 Error Suggestion | Supports | Error messages say how to fix the problem (e.g. “Use at least 15 characters. Four or more unrelated words work well.”, “Paste some documentation text first”). Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) | Supports | Actions that delete or replace the user's data (erase all data, start a new assessment, load the sample, import, replace an implementation statement) ask for confirmation. Passphrases must be entered twice when created. Assessments can be exported and re-imported. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) | Supports | Unlocking an encrypted assessment requires a passphrase. Pasting is allowed and the fields declare autocomplete (new-password / current-password), so password managers can supply it; a “Show passphrase” option is provided. No other cognitive function test is used. Evidence: code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |
| 4.1.3 Status Messages | Supports | Results of actions (answer status, scope changes, analysis results, search result counts, import, export, lock and unlock confirmations) are announced through a polite live region without moving focus (scripted check). Form error summaries use role=alert. Evidence: scripted checks status-messages (1 runs, all passed); code review (pending re-review after UI changes). |

### Chapter 4: Functional Performance Statements

| Criteria | Conformance level | Remarks and explanations |
|---|---|---|
| 4.2.1 Usage without vision | Supports | Supported through conformance to the WCAG criteria in chapter 9: all content and functions are exposed through native semantics, and the generated accessibility tree snapshots confirm names, roles and states. Not yet verified with screen reader users (see Notes). |
| 4.2.2 Usage with limited vision | Supports | Supports browser zoom to 400% without loss of content, meets contrast minimums in light and dark themes, follows the operating system's dark mode, and supports Windows forced-colours mode. |
| 4.2.3 Usage without perception of colour | Supports | Colour is never the only way information is conveyed (see 9.1.4.1). |
| 4.2.4 Usage without hearing | Not Applicable | The product does not use audio. |
| 4.2.5 Usage with limited hearing | Not Applicable | The product does not use audio. |
| 4.2.6 Usage with no or limited vocal capability | Not Applicable | The product does not require speech input. |
| 4.2.7 Usage with limited manipulation or strength | Supports | Fully keyboard operable, with no gestures, dragging or time limits, and targets of at least 24 by 24 CSS px. |
| 4.2.8 Usage with limited reach | Not Applicable | Software only; there are no physical controls. |
| 4.2.9 Minimize photosensitive seizure triggers | Supports | No flashing content; motion is removed when the user prefers reduced motion. |
| 4.2.10 Usage with limited cognition, language or learning | Partially Supports | Plain-language questions, a “why we ask” explanation for each scoping question, consistent navigation, no time limits, confirmation before data loss, and progress shown at each step. However, the subject matter (ITSG-33 security controls) is technical, and the product uses specialized terms and acronyms that some users will find hard to understand; a glossary is not yet provided. |
| 4.2.11 Privacy | Supports | Accessibility features do not expose personal information. Assessment data stays in the user's browser. |
